Docker is an open source project.
At its heart, it aims to solve the issue of an application working on
one platform and not the other one.

"Docker makes the process of application deployment very easy and efficient
and resolves a lot of issues related to deploying applications."

It is the world's leading software container platform. It is a tool
designed to make it easier to deploy and run applications by using
containers.

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts
it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one
package.

Containers are light-weight compared to virtualization.

An application inside a container can run on any system that has Docker
installed. So there is no need to build and configure app multiple times
on different platforms. Docker containers can run on any platform.

With Docker every application works in isolation in its own container and 
does not interferes with other applications running on the same system.

Running a image creates a container
